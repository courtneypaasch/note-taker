  This is a burger order application. Users enter the type of burger they would like and it cues on the left side of the screen. Then when they are finished they click the "Devour it" button and it moves to the right side with the other finished burgers. All entries are stored in a database until the user clears the database with the "Delete the evidence!" button.
